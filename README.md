# HonkaiImpact3rdDialog
A project that collects Honkai Impact 3rd text corpus

本项目收集崩坏三游戏对话语料

## Description

Unlike other Hoyoverse games, Honkai Impact 3rd's dialog corpus is a bit harder to find (Although there are lots of videos)

For now, this repo simply copies a fan-edit **English** game lore transcription google-doc that I encounter from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/houkai3rd/comments/152n9m7/is_there_anywhere_i_can_find_the_script_for/)

Act 3 - Swept Away:
Gameplay 16-9 - Saving the Roost I:
Tesla: What the hell is going on?
Mei and Tesla were shocked by the scene they saw outside the Helios.
The sea that flooded the city was calm yesterday, but the water rose by more than 10 meters overnight.
Mei: This isn’t normal at all.
Mei: …The children might be in danger! We need to head to the Roost now!
Mei: No, Honkai beasts are gathering over there!
Sora: Hey! Mei!
Mei: Sora! I’m so glad you’re alright.
The children were busy moving the warehouse supplies. They were ill-prepared for the flood.
Tesla: All nearby Honkai beasts neutralised. Stay vigilant. We’ve gotta stay on guard.
Tesla: We must move the kids and supplies to higher ground. Tell them that I’m moving mechs into the shelters.
Sora: Oh… okay.


Gameplay 16-10 - Saving the Roost II:
Boom!
The residents vacated the lower levels of the Roost in less than 20 minutes.
Sora: Why did the flood waters rise? The city… has become very strange…
Mei: Dr. Tesla, I have a bad feeling about this.
Mei: The Honkai beasts are riled up, and they’re appearing in greater numbers, as if they’re… attracted to something.
Sora: Is it because of that… huge beast I saw yesterday?
Sora: I’ve never seen it before… it was like… the king of the monsters…
Mei: Where did you see it?
Sora: Near the Nagazora Wall. I can take you there.
Mei: This is urgent. We must investigate immediately.
